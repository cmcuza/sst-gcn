# SST-GCN

This is the python repository associated to the paper _Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for
Stochastic Traffic Speed Imputation_ [1]

The paper implements a method to estimate the missing speed distribution given a traffic dataset. 

### Paper Abstract
The rapid increase of traffic data generated by different sensing systems opens many opportunities to improve transportation services. One important improvement is to provide stochastic routing services which compute the arrival time probabilities for each suggested route instead of only the expected travel time. Such highresolution routing services rely on stochastic speed data capturing the speed distributions of vehicles in a road network. However, traffic datasets typically have many missing values, which prevents
the construction of the stochastic speeds. We thus propose the Stochastic Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SSTGCN) architecture to accurately impute missing speed distributions in a road network. SST-GCN combines Temporal Convolutional Networks and Graph Convolutional Networks into a single framework to capture both spatial and temporal correlations between road segments and time intervals, thereby providing a highly accurate estimation model for speed distributions. Moreover, to cope with datasets with many missing values, we propose a novel selfadaptive context-aware diffusion process that regulates the propagated information around the network, avoiding the spread of false
information. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of SST-GCN on real-world datasets, showing that SST-GCN achieves from 4.6% to 71% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines, and can scale to big road networks.

### Requirements

The code is written in Python 3.7 and Pytorch. Specifically:

+ numpy==1.19.5
+ pyemd==0.5.1
+ scikit-learn==0.23.2
+ scipy==1.6.1
+ torch==1.7.1

### Dataset

The dataset is given already preprocessed on each fold (1-5). The raw data is described in [2]

The dataset is divided according to the missing information rate, e.g, _rm_0.5_ means that 50% of the speed distributions is missing during training.

The dataset is further divided according the number of edges of the road network subset, i.e., 173 and 40.

Highway Tollgates Network dataset [3] is not public any more, thus, we don't share it here. 

### Run

To run check first the parameters on the file _config.py_. Then, 

``
python run_cross_validation.py
``

This will run a full 5-fold-cross validation and return the evaluation metrics for each fold as well the average.

Please note that the package does not include implementations of baseline methods.
